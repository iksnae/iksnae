added new project: [GCal](http://code.google.com/p/iksnae/wiki/GCal)

# Current Project: Groop #
Groop is a cross-platform Adobe AIR-based collaboration and project management tool. Groop is built on Google data services allowing users to easily begin using it with their Google accounts. Future plans include allowing users to access their data even when offline, then synchronizing once reconnected.

**ProjectManagement**

Groop allows users to create a Project and add members. Project members can create and modify tasks associated with a project. These tasks contain title, description, priority, due date, status and other properties. Tasks can be assigned to one or more members. Members of a project are notified when a task is assigned to them. A log of task updates is accessible, by the project owner.Future plans for Groop include SCRUM support. Including but not limited to, burnout charts, backlog, sprint notes, sprint planning and Daily SCRUM notes.

**TimeManagement**

Users can access, manage and share their Google Calenders with other Groop users in an easy to use integrated user interface. Users can also log and track their time spent on projects and even break their time into tasks. Optional notifications remind users when specific events are coming up.

**UserCollaboration**

Groop users can retrieve, upload and share files from their Google Docs application. Future plans include the ability to view/edit files within the application.

**UserCommunication**

Groop Users can connect with other users as well as their Google friends via text chat, built on Google Talk. Future plans include the ability to have Audio Video chat.
